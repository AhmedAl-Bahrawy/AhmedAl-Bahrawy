# About

</br>

Hello World :-)
</br>
My Name is Ahmed AL-Bahrawy call me "Thunder" OK ?
</br>
Remember, Experience is not measured by age
</br>
Various sources but most of them are self learning
</br>
I learned soft skills from the digital Cubs of Egypt initiative, ITI, and NTI.
</br>
Don't worry, I've worked under pressure and with Teams before.
</br>
I participated in about 8 presentations with Teams, 7 of which we won the title of best team.
